# inkdown

Inkdown is a lightweight markdown and org mode inspired langugage. It is built for use client side for chat applications.

## Example
```inkdown
Just some standard text. Gets rendered as a paragraph

A blank line between two blocks of text will separate two paragraphs
but just a standard linebreak won't. It will be removed and replaced with just a space.

* Heading 1
** Heading 2
*** Heading 3

- unordered
- lists
- use
- dashes

~ ordered
~ lists
~ use
~ tildes


- indent
-- lists
--- like
---- this

~ ordered
~~ lists
~~~ too

Sometimes you wanna mention `code` in your prose

But sometimes you need a full block:
\`\`\`javascript
console.log("hello world!")
\`\`\`
```
